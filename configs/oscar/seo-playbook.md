# Oscar's SEO Playbook

These rules are embedded by construction — they should emerge naturally from good writing, not be imposed as a compliance checklist.

## 1. Structural Rules
- One `<h1>` per page — from the brief, verbatim
- `<h2>` for major sections — keyword-aware but descriptive, not abstract
- `<h3>` for subsections — never skip heading levels
- `<section id="...">` for each major content area — ids should be descriptive slugs

## 2. On-Page SEO — Natural Integration
- Primary keyword in H1 and in the first 100 words — not forced, reads naturally. Use varied language naturally; don't repeat the same phrase robotically, but don't force synonym injection either
- Section H2s carry topical keywords — they describe what the section covers, which naturally includes relevant terms
- CTAs: at minimum in the hero section and final section, optionally mid-page after a trust-building section. Direct and specific — "Schedule your EMT course" not "Contact us today"

## 3. Entity Clarity and Content Structure
- Entity clarity: on commercial pages, make the entity identity clear early and naturally — who does what, where. The page should leave no ambiguity about the business, its primary service, and its location without requiring readers to hunt for it.
- Attributive statements: claims should be clear and attributable — "Summit Medical Academy offers EMT training in Boise" not "training is available here"
- Direct answers: for any PAA question or query fan-out item the brief identifies, answer it directly and completely in the first sentence of the relevant paragraph. Don't bury the answer.
- Lists: use `<ol>` for sequential steps, `<ul>` for non-sequential items. Substantive list items — full sentences, not fragments. 3–7 items is the extractable sweet spot.
- Schema alignment: page content entity names must match schema entity names exactly — if the schema says "EMT Training" the page should not call it "Emergency Medical Technician Courses"
- Section context clarity: each `<section>` should be independently understandable — a reader arriving at that section directly should know what it covers without needing surrounding page context. This does NOT mean each section must restate the business name and location. It means each section's `<h2>` + opening sentence must establish sufficient context. Exception: sections that build on each other sequentially (process steps, numbered how-to content) are exempt — but the `<h2>` must name the step, not just number it ("Step 3: Schedule Your Skills Assessment" passes; "Step 3" fails).
- AI optimization patterns — apply conditionally, not uniformly. Evaluate each section against its intent and structural role before choosing a pattern:
  - Direct-answer opening: apply when the section targets a question-intent keyword, corresponds to a PAA item, or is explicitly flagged [OPPORTUNITY] or [AI CITATION GAP] in the brief. Do NOT apply when the section is context-setting, narrative, building an argument, or part of a sequential explanation.
  - Q&A substructure (h3 question + p answer): apply when multiple distinct questions fall under one H2. Do NOT apply when the section develops a single continuous argument or is a commercial/transactional conversion section.
  - Self-contained chunk scope: apply when the section covers a discrete, independently searchable concept. Relax when sections are explicitly linked as a sequence in the brief.

### Content Dating and Freshness Signals
- Time-sensitive content (regulatory, pricing, certifications, seasonal) must include:
  - `datePublished` and `dateModified` in JSON-LD schema (with [PLACEHOLDER] stubs)
  - Visible "Last updated: [date]" line near top of page
- Evergreen content (service descriptions, process explanations) should omit visible dating
- Apply when Pam's brief includes `[TIME-SENSITIVE]` or topic involves regulations/certifications/pricing
- `dateModified` only updates on substantive content changes (not typos/formatting)

## 4. Content Quality
- Readability: short sentences (12–20 words average), short paragraphs (2–4 sentences), active voice, 8th–9th grade reading level
- Trust signals on commercial and transactional pages: relevant credentials, years in business, licensing, insurance, reviews, certifications — whatever applies to this client. Every claim needs a basis.
- Tone matches intent: commercial pages earn trust, transactional pages move toward action, informational pages educate completely
- No thin sections: if a section can't be written substantively, it shouldn't exist as its own section. (Starter pages — brief carries a Starter Page Directive — are the deliberate exception: the whole page is one tight direct-answer section by design.)
- Bottom-of-funnel length ceiling: when the brief's Implementation Notes carry a Target Word Count from a Bottom-of-Funnel Length Directive, treat it as a directive with a hard ceiling of 800 words — Decision-stage conversion pages beyond that dilute conversion focus. Hitting the ceiling means cutting educational depth (it belongs on linked consideration-stage pages), never compressing proof, differentiation, or the conversion path.
- Starter page ceiling: when the brief carries a Starter Page Directive, the page is a 200–400-word direct-answer test page — hard ceiling 400 words, the exact H1 from the brief (for /faq/ pages: the question verbatim), the answer complete in the first 1–2 sentences, exactly the ONE internal link from the brief's map, minimal schema as briefed. Do not expand it into a full page — it earns expansion through GSC impressions, not upfront effort. These two directives are the only cases where a word count is binding; everywhere else, intent drives length.
- Citation signals: on informational and commercial pages, prefer specific verifiable claims over general statements. "Idaho Medical Academy's EMT program runs [PLACEHOLDER: program_duration] weeks" is more citation-worthy than "a comprehensive EMT program." If specific data exists in the client profile (reviews, certifications, years, accreditation body, program duration, pass rates), use it with attribution. If not, placeholder it. In the production notes, flag any section that relies entirely on general claims where specific client data would substantially improve citation-worthiness — label these `[CITATION OPPORTUNITY: needs <field>]`.

## 5. Content Effort Requirements

Every service or article page Oscar produces must target replication difficulty — content
that could not be written by someone who doesn't actually do this work. Apply the
following dimensions where relevant to the page type. This is not a checklist where
all five must appear on every page. Intent resolution comes first; effort differentiation
operates within that intent.

### Source-of-Truth Hierarchy

Practitioner-level specificity comes from, in order:

1. The Pam brief's research section (primary — use verbatim where available)
2. `client_profiles` fields (service descriptions, differentiators, service area)
3. Verifiable industry standards (building codes, equipment warranties, published pricing ranges)

If none of the three supply the specificity a dimension requires for a given section,
insert `[PLACEHOLDER: <dimension> — client context insufficient]` and move on.
Do NOT fabricate technical detail. A flagged placeholder is better than invented precision.

### Readability and Precision

Existing readability targets (12–20 word sentences, 8th–9th grade reading level) apply
to the overall page structure. Technical precision takes priority over the sentence-length
target when diagnostic or process specificity requires it. Keep overall section structure
scannable — short paragraphs, subheads — even when individual technical sentences run longer.

---

### Dimension 1: Diagnostic Specificity

Describe how a practitioner identifies the problem — not just what the problem is.

**Avoid**:
> "A leaking pipe can cause water damage. Signs include wet spots on walls and higher water bills."

**Target**:
> "Pinhole leaks in copper lines typically present as intermittent pressure drops rather than
> visible moisture. Run a pressure test at the main shutoff. If it holds for 10 minutes, active
> leaks are ruled out. Pressure bleed below 15 PSI in that window confirms an active leak
> downstream of the meter. Wet spots two rooms from the actual leak are common in slab
> foundations; concrete capillary migration carries water laterally before it surfaces."

---

### Dimension 2: Process Specificity with Real Constraints

Describe the actual execution sequence including constraints, exceptions, and failure
modes a practitioner encounters — not a generic summary of the service.

**Avoid**:
> "Our technicians will assess the problem, provide a quote, and complete the repair efficiently."

**Target**:
> "Lock rekeying requires the existing key or a bump key entry. Without either, the cylinder
> must be drilled, which voids the manufacturer warranty on Schlage B-series deadbolts.
> Standard residential hardware takes 8–12 minutes per cylinder. Medeco and Abloy high-security
> cylinders require a separate pinning kit and run 25–35 minutes. Same-day rekeying on standard
> hardware doesn't require a parts order. Restricted keyway upgrades do."

---

### Dimension 3: Local/Contextual Specificity

Reference real conditions of the service market, geography, or regulatory environment.
Generic city mentions don't count. Specific regulatory requirements, local environmental
conditions, or market-specific constraints do.

**Avoid**:
> "We serve [city] and surrounding areas. Local regulations may apply."

**Target**:
> "Idaho doesn't require a state contractor license for locksmithing, but Ada County enforces
> a local business registration with a background check requirement. Unregistered locksmiths
> operating in Boise can be cited under Ada County Code 3-2-1. A legitimate operator can
> verify their registration on-site when you request it."

---

### Dimension 4: Comparison and Tradeoff Resolution

Resolve real decision points with specific criteria, not marketing preference claims.
The customer is choosing between options; give them the actual logic for deciding.

**Avoid**:
> "Our products are better quality than the competition."

**Target**:
> "Rekey vs. replace: rekeying costs $25–75 per cylinder and preserves existing hardware.
> Lock replacement runs $80–200 depending on grade. Rekey when the lock body is in good
> condition and you're changing access only (lost key, tenant turnover). Replace when the
> bolt face shows wear, the deadbolt throw is sticky, or you're upgrading security grade.
> Hardware margins are higher than labor margins; a replacement quote isn't always the
> right recommendation."

---

### Dimension 5: Evidence Anchoring (Applies to All Article Pages)

Substitute real numbers, standards, and measurements for approximations wherever the
claim can be verified from the source-of-truth hierarchy above. Evidence anchoring is
the baseline expectation for all service and article pages — the dimensions above are
additional emphasis per page type.

**Avoid**:
> "Most water heaters last around 10–15 years. Replacement costs vary."

**Target**:
> "Tank water heaters carry a 6–12 year manufacturer warranty. Beyond that window, the
> anode rod is typically depleted and sediment buildup reduces efficiency 10–15% per year.
> A 12-year-old 50-gallon gas unit running 3 hours per day costs roughly $180 per year more
> than a new unit at that degradation rate."

If a figure cannot be verified from the source-of-truth hierarchy, insert:
`[PLACEHOLDER: verify this figure — source not available in brief]`

---

### Effort Risk Flags (from Pam briefs)

When Pam's `metadata.md` includes `effort_risk` flags, resolve them before finalizing HTML
using the source-of-truth hierarchy. Flags use the same `[PLACEHOLDER: ...]` convention
as missing client data.

| Flag | What it means | Oscar action |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| `effort_risk: diagnostic_gap` | No practitioner-level diagnostic detail in brief | Add diagnostic sequence from client_profiles or industry standard; if insufficient, insert `[PLACEHOLDER: diagnostic sequence — client context insufficient]` |
| `effort_risk: locality_gap` | No region-specific detail available | Use service_area context where possible; if absent, insert `[PLACEHOLDER: local regulatory or environmental detail — region research needed]` |
| `effort_risk: evidence_gap` | Numeric claims are approximations without source basis | Use verifiable industry standards; if unavailable, insert `[PLACEHOLDER: verify this figure — source not available in brief]` |
| `effort_risk: commodity_floor` | Page is inherently generic (About, Contact, Legal) | Expected — effort dimensions do not apply to these page types, no action required |

---

### Page Type Guidance

Dimension 5 (Evidence Anchoring) is the baseline for all article pages. The primary
dimensions column indicates additional emphasis per page type.

| Page type | Effort target | Additional emphasis |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Core service page | HIGH | Dimensions 1, 2 |
| Location service page | HIGH | Dimension 3 |
| Informational / how-to | HIGH | Dimensions 2, 4 |
| Silo hub / category page | MEDIUM | Specificity of sub-topic framing |
| About / Contact / Legal | N/A | Effort dimensions not applicable |

## 6. Internal Links
- Every link from the brief's internal linking map must appear in the content, contextually embedded
- Anchor text: descriptive and specific — "our EMT certification requirements guide" not "click here" or "learn more"
- Relative paths only
- Links should appear in natural reading positions — not clustered at the bottom
- Links marked "(planned)" in the brief's map point to pages not yet live — embed them with relative paths as usual, and flag each one in Production Notes for human verification at publish time
- Cap total internal links at 25 per page — beyond that, the authority each individual link passes becomes negligible (dilution). The brief's map comes first; if you add contextual links beyond the map, draw them from the brief's candidate tables and prefer targets listed at position 4–20 (the band where authority transfer does the most good), never position 1–3 pages (they don't need help)

## 7. Anti-Patterns — Never Do These
Writing: "When it comes to...", "whether you need X or Y", "In fact,", "Don't hesitate to...", "we understand that...", rhetorical questions as section openers, em dashes more than once per 500 words, ending sections with "contact us today"

SEO: keyword bolded everywhere, same exact geo modifier in every paragraph, FAQ answers that just restate the body content in question form, links clustered in one paragraph, padding a section to hit a word count

Structural: repeated information with different wording, sections that exist only to contain a keyword, H2s that don't describe what the section covers

AI formatting: applying direct-answer openings, Q&A structure, or section context framing to every section regardless of intent — this destroys narrative flow and is worse than no optimization. Image-of-table: describing tabular data in prose when a `<table>` would be more precise and machine-readable

## 8. Production Notes — Flag for Human Editor
At the end of every file, produce a production notes comment block that includes:
- List of all [PLACEHOLDER: x] items requiring human completion before publish
- Internal link count and confirmation all brief links are implemented
- Keyword usage summary (primary keyword appearances, any density concerns)
- Any flags: sections where competitor coverage significantly exceeds this page, PAA questions from brief that weren't addressed and why, schema fields that need client verification
- **Information Gain Assessment**: Evaluate and report:
  - `[ORIGINAL INSIGHT]` — sections with client-specific analysis, proprietary data, practitioner knowledge
  - `[CLIENT INPUT NEEDED]` — commodity sections that would benefit from specific client data (case studies, process details, pricing, outcomes)
  - `[COMMODITY CONTENT]` — entire page lacks original insights (expected for About/Contact pages per `effort_risk: commodity_floor`)
- Word count

## 9. Validation Checklist
- Information gain check — verify production notes include Information Gain Assessment for non-commodity pages
- Citation signal check — verify at least one specific attributable claim per commercial/informational section; flag gaps in production notes
- Content patterns applied conditionally (not uniformly) — verify each direct-answer opening and Q&A structure has a question-intent or [OPPORTUNITY]/[AI CITATION GAP] basis in the brief
- Figure/table markup — verify `<figure>` + `<figcaption>` stub present for every `<!-- IMAGE: -->` placeholder; verify HTML `<table>` used for any comparative or structured data
- Schema-to-prose consistency check — verify every schema attribute value matches its prose equivalent

## 10. HTML Markup and Media

- Tables: use `<table>` with `<thead>` and `<tbody>` for comparative or structured data (program costs, certification levels, scheduling options, step comparisons). Never describe tabular data in prose when a table would be more precise.
- Image placeholders: every `<!-- IMAGE: [description] -->` comment must be immediately followed by a `<figure>` + `<figcaption>` stub:
  ```html
  <!-- IMAGE: [description including topic context and what the figure would show] -->
  <figure>
    <figcaption>[PLACEHOLDER: caption describing the image above]</figcaption>
  </figure>
  ```
  This preserves the semantic relationship for when the human editor inserts the actual image. Do not use bare `<!-- IMAGE: -->` comments without the figure wrapper.
- Alt text guidance: in the `<!-- IMAGE: -->` comment description, include the topic context and what the visual would show — this gives the human editor the information they need to write accurate alt text. Format: `<!-- IMAGE: [what it shows] — [why it's here / what it supports] -->`
- Video recommendations: when a section covers a process, demonstration, facility, or team introduction where video would add genuine value beyond what text and images convey, add a `<!-- VIDEO: [description of what the video would show] — [why video specifically adds value here] -->` comment. This is a recommendation for the content team, not a placeholder system — not every page needs video. Flag only where video is a clear information-gain asset (e.g., training demonstrations, equipment walkthroughs, facility tours, technique explanations). When the brief flags a video-carousel SERP opportunity for the target keyword, the bar for adding a `<!-- VIDEO: -->` recommendation drops (the SERP itself proves demand for video on this query) — and if the brief's schema includes a VideoObject stub, carry it through in the JSON-LD adjacent to the video recommendation rather than dropping it.
