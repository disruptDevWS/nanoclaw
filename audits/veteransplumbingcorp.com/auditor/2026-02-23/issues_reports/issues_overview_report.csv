"Issue Name","Issue Type","Issue Priority","URLs","% of Total","Description","How To Fix","Help URL"
"Images: Missing Size Attributes","Opportunity","Low","1","5.260","Image elements without dimensions (width and height size attributes) specified in the HTML. This can cause large layout shifts as the page loads and be frustrating experience for users. It is one of the major reasons that contributes to a high Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).","Define all image sizes as their native size using width and height attributes in the HTML. This allows the browser to calculate enough space for each image before it loads, avoiding large layout shifts.",""
"H1: Non-Sequential","Warning","Low","11","78.570","Pages with an <h1> that is not the first heading on the page. Heading elements should be in a logical sequentially-descending order. The purpose of heading elements is to convey the structure of the page and they should be in logical order from <h1> to <h6>, which helps navigating the page and users that rely on assistive technologies.","Ensure the <h1> is the first heading on the page. Headings should be in a logical sequential order from <h1> to <h6>. Review and update page heading levels so they are descending in order, for example the first heading level should be an <h1>, and this should be followed by an <h2>.",""
"Links: Internal Outlinks With No Anchor Text","Opportunity","Low","14","100.000","Pages that have internal links without anchor text or images that are hyperlinked without alt text. Anchor text is the visible text and words used in hyperlinks that provide users and search engines context about the content of the target page. Internal outlinks without anchor text can be seen in the 'Outlinks' tab, with the 'All Link Types' filter set to 'Hyperlinks', where the 'Anchor Text' column is blank, or if an image, the 'Alt Text' column is also blank. Export in bulk via 'Bulk Export > Links > Internal Outlinks With No Anchor Text'.","Review the missing anchor text outlinks and where appropriate include useful and descriptive anchor text to help users and search engines.",""
"Page Titles: Over 60 Characters","Opportunity","Medium","8","57.140","Pages which have page titles that exceed the configured limit. Characters over this limit might be truncated in Google's search results and carry less weight in scoring.","Write concise page titles to ensure important words are not truncated in the search results, not visible to users and potentially weighted less in scoring.",""
"Images: Missing Alt Text","Issue","Low","1","5.260","Images that have an alt attribute, but are missing alt text. Click the address of the image and then the 'Image Details' tab in the lower window pane to view which pages have the image on them, and are missing alt text. Images should have descriptive alternative text about its purpose, which helps the blind and visually impaired, and the search engines understand it and its relevance to the web page.","Include descriptive alt text for images to help users and the search engines understand them better. Where possible, decorative images should be provided using CSS background images or alternatively a null (empty) alt text should be provided (alt="""") so that they can be ignored by assistive technologies, such as screen readers.",""
"Links: Non-Descriptive Anchor Text In Internal Outlinks","Opportunity","Low","1","7.140","Pages that have internal outlinks with anchor text that is not descriptive, such as 'click here' or 'learn more' based upon the preferences under 'Config > Spider > Preferences'. Anchor text is the visible text and words used in hyperlinks that provide users and search engines context about the content of the target page. Internal outlinks with non-descriptive anchor text can be seen in the 'Outlinks' tab, with the 'All Link Types' filter set to 'Hyperlinks', where the 'Anchor Text' column has words such as 'click here', or 'learn more'. Export in bulk via 'Bulk Export > Links > Non-Descriptive Anchor Text In Internal Outlinks'.","Review the non-descriptive anchor text in outlinks and where appropriate update them to include useful and descriptive anchor text to help provide context to both users and search engines.",""
"URL: Uppercase","Warning","Low","5","35.710","URLs that have uppercase characters within them. URLs are case sensitive, so as best practice generally URLs should be lowercase, to avoid any potential mix ups and duplicate URLs.","Ideally lowercase characters should be used for URLs only. However, changing URLs is a big decision, and often it's not worth changing them for SEO purposes alone. If URLs are changed, then appropriate 301 redirects must be implemented.",""
"Content: Low Content Pages","Opportunity","Medium","2","14.290","Pages with a word count that is below the default 200 words. The word count is based upon the content area settings used in the analysis which can be configured via 'Config > Content > Area'. There isn't a minimum word count for pages in reality, but the search engines do require descriptive text to understand the purpose of a page. This filter should only be used as a rough guide to help identify pages that might be improved by adding more descriptive content in the context of the website and page's purpose. Some websites, such as ecommerce, will naturally have lower word counts, which can be acceptable if a products details can be communicated efficiently.","Consider including additional descriptive content to help the user and search engines better understand the page.",""
"H2: Multiple","Warning","Low","8","57.140","Pages which have multiple <h2>s. This is not an issue as HTML standards allow multiple <h2>'s when used in a logical hierarchical heading structure. However, this filter can help you quickly scan to review if they are used appropriately.","Ensure <h2>s are used in a logical hierarchical heading structure, and update where appropriate utilising the full heading rank between (h3 - h6) for additional headings.",""
"Meta Description: Over 985 Pixels","Opportunity","Low","1","7.140","Pages which have meta descriptions over Google's estimated pixel length limit for snippets. Google snippet length is actually based upon pixels limits, rather than a character length. The SEO Spider tries to match the latest pixel truncation points in the SERPs, but it is an approximation and Google adjusts them frequently.","Write concise meta descriptions to ensure important words are not truncated in the search results, and not visible to users.",""
"Page Titles: Over 561 Pixels","Opportunity","Medium","8","57.140","Pages which have page titles over Google's estimated pixel length limit for titles in search results. Google snippet length is actually based upon pixels limits, rather than a character length. The SEO Spider tries to match the latest pixel truncation points in the SERPs, but it is an approximation and Google adjusts them frequently.","Write concise page titles to ensure important words are not truncated in the search results, not visible to users and potentially weighted less in scoring.",""
"Security: Unsafe Cross-Origin Links","Warning","Low","14","100.000","URLs that link to external websites using the target=""_blank"" attribute (to open in a new tab), without using rel=""noopener"" (or rel=""noreferrer"") at the same time. Using target=""_blank"" alone leaves those pages exposed to both security and performance issues for some legacy browsers, which are estimated to be below 5% of market share. Setting target=""_blank"" on <a> elements implicitly provides the same rel behavior as setting rel=""noopener"" which does not set window.opener for most modern browsers, such as Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Edge.  The external links that contain the target=""_blank"" attribute by itself can be viewed in the 'outlinks' tab and 'target' column. They can be exported alongside the pages they are linked from via 'Bulk Export > Security > Unsafe Cross-Origin Links'.","Consider the benefits of including the rel=""noopener"" link attribute on any links that contain the target=""_blank"" attribute to avoid security and performance issues for the users of legacy browsers that may visit the website.",""
"Response Codes: External Client Error (4xx)","Warning","Low","1","1.890","External URLs with a client-side error. This indicates a problem occurred with the URL request and can include responses such as 400 bad request, 403 Forbidden, 404 Page Not Found, 410 Removed, 429 Too Many Requests and more. A 404 'Page Not Found' is the most common, and often referred to as a broken link. View URLs that link to errors using the lower 'inlinks' tab and export them in bulk via 'Bulk Export > Response Codes > External > Client Error (4xx) inlinks'.","All links on a website should ideally resolve to 200 'OK' URLs. Errors such as 404 broken links should be updated so users are taken to the correct URL, or removed. A 403 forbidden error occurs when a web server denies access to the SEO Spider's request and can often be resolved by switching the user-agent to Chrome via 'Config > User-Agent'. If they can be viewed in a browser, then it's often not an issue.",""
"H1: Missing","Issue","Medium","2","14.290","Pages which have a missing <h1>, the content is empty or has a whitespace. The <h1> should describe the main title and purpose of the page and are considered to be one of the stronger on-page ranking signals.","Ensure important pages have concise, descriptive and unique headings to help users, and enable search engines to score and rank the page for relevant search queries.",""
"H2: Missing","Warning","Low","5","35.710","Pages which have a missing <h2>, the content is empty or has a whitespace. The <h2> heading is often used to describe sections or topics within a document. They act as signposts for the user, and can help search engines understand the page.","Consider using logical and descriptive <h2>s on important pages that help the user and search engines better understand the page.",""
"Security: Missing Secure Referrer-Policy Header","Warning","Low","14","100.000","URLs missing 'no-referrer-when-downgrade', 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin', 'no-referrer' or 'strict-origin' policies in the Referrer-Policy header. When using HTTPS, it's important that the URLs do not leak in non-HTTPS requests. This can expose users to 'man in the middle' attacks, as anyone on the network can view them.","Consider setting a referrer policy of strict-origin-when-cross-origin. It retains much of the referrer's usefulness, while mitigating the risk of leaking data cross-origins.",""
"H2: Over 70 Characters","Opportunity","Low","1","7.140","Pages which have <h2>s over the configured limit. There is no hard limit for characters in an <h2>, however they should be clear and concise for users and long headings might be less helpful","Write concise <h2>s for users, including target keywords where natural for users - without keyword stuffing.",""
"H1: Multiple","Warning","Medium","2","14.290","Pages which have multiple <h1>s. While this is not strictly an issue because HTML5 standards allow multiple <h1>s on a page, there are some problems with this modern approach in terms of usability. It's advised to use heading rank (h1-h6) to convey document structure. The classic HTML4 standard defines there should only be a single <h1> per page, and this is still generally recommended for users and SEO.","Consider updating the HTML to include a single <h1> on each page, and utilising the full heading rank between (h2 - h6) for additional headings.",""
"Meta Description: Over 155 Characters","Opportunity","Low","3","21.430","Pages which have meta descriptions over the configured limit. Characters over this limit might be truncated in Google's search results.","Write concise meta descriptions to ensure important words are not truncated in the search results, and not visible to users.",""
"Images: Over 100 KB","Opportunity","Medium","12","63.160","Large images over a size threshold. Page speed is extremely important for users and SEO and often large resources such as images are one of the most common issues that slow down web pages. This filter simply acts as a general rule of thumb to help identify images that are fairly large in file size and may take longer to load. These should be considered for optimisation, alongside opportunities identified in the PageSpeed tab which uses the PSI API and Lighthouse to audit speed. This can help identify images that haven't been optimised in size, load offscreen, are unoptimised etc.","Uncompressed images bloat pages with unnecessary bytes, so ensure images are optimised with compression, properly scaled, and using the best image format to reduce file size where possible.",""
"H2: Non-Sequential","Warning","Low","1","7.140","Pages with an <h2> that is not the second heading level after the <h1> on the page. Heading elements should be in a logical sequentially-descending order. The purpose of heading elements is to convey the structure of the page and they should be in logical order from <h1> to <h6>, which helps navigating the page and users that rely on assistive technologies.","Ensure the <h2> is the second heading on the page. Headings should be in a logical sequential order from <h1> to <h6>. Review and update page heading levels so they are descending in order, for example the heading element following an <h1> should be an <h2>, rather than an <h3>.",""
