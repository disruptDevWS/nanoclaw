## 1. Keyword Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total ranked keywords | 101 |
| Total search volume (all keywords) | 33,240/mo |
| Average position | 52.2 |
| Estimated traffic value (ETV) | $430.38/mo |
| Estimated paid traffic cost equivalent | $10,676.48/mo |

### Position Distribution

| Position Range | Keywords | % of Total |
|----------------|----------|------------|
| 1-3 | 1 | 1.0% |
| 4-10 | 2 | 2.0% |
| 11-20 | 9 | 8.9% |
| 21-50 | 42 | 41.6% |
| 51-100 | 38 | 37.6% |
| 100+ | 9 | 8.9% |

**Key takeaway:** Only 3 keywords rank in the top 10. The vast majority (88%) of ranked keywords sit on page 3 or deeper, where they generate almost zero clicks. There is significant room to improve.

### Branded vs Non-Branded

| Type | Keywords | Total Volume | Avg Position |
|------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Branded (contains "veterans" or "veteran") | 21 | 3,330/mo | 30.5 |
| Non-branded | 80 | 29,910/mo | 57.9 |

**Key takeaway:** Non-branded keywords represent 90% of total volume but rank at an average position of 57.9, meaning this traffic is almost entirely unrealized. Improving non-branded visibility is the primary growth lever.

### Keywords Currently in the Top 10 (only 3)

| Keyword | Volume | Position | CPC | Intent |
|---------|--------|----------|-----|--------|
| veterans plumbing boise | 70 | 1 | $41.99 | navigational |
| veterans plumbing | 1,000 | 4 | $22.65 | navigational |
| veterans plumbing and heating | 50 | 6 | $20.16 | commercial |

All top-10 rankings are branded terms. The site has zero non-branded top-10 visibility.

---

## 3. Intent Breakdown

| Intent | Keywords | Total Volume | % of Volume |
|--------|----------|-------------|------------|
| Navigational | 46 | 18,330 | 56.1% |
| Commercial | 26 | 8,010 | 24.5% |
| Transactional | 28 | 6,310 | 19.3% |

**Key takeaway:** Over half the volume is navigational (brand + local business lookups). The commercial and transactional keywords (44% of total volume) represent the highest-conversion opportunities -- these are people actively looking for plumbing services or products. One branded-noise keyword ("veterans boise," 590/mo) has been excluded from this breakdown (see footnote).

---

## 4. Top Ranking URLs

| URL | Keywords | Total Volume |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| / (homepage) | 55 | 23,470 |
| /Water-Heater-Replacement | 14 | 700 |
| /water-softeners-nampa-idaho | 4 | 1,790 |
| /common-causes-of-low-water-pressure-and-how-to-fix-them | 3 | 4,890 |
| /hot-water-heater-meridian | 4 | 320 |
| /Water-Softener-System | 3 | 420 |
| /water-softeners-Kuna-id | 3 | 280 |
| /the-role-of-drainage-systems-in-residential-plumbing | 2 | 180 |
| /Residential-Plumbing-Services | 2 | 140 |
| /contact-us | 1 | 590 |

**Key takeaway:** The homepage carries 54% of all keyword rankings (55 of 101). This is a sign that the site lacks dedicated, optimized service and location pages. Search engines are defaulting to the homepage because there is no better match. This creates a major opportunity: purpose-built landing pages for key services and locations would distribute ranking power and improve relevance signals.

## 6. Striking Distance Keywords (positions 11-20)

These are the closest to page 1 and represent the lowest-effort improvement opportunities.

| Keyword | Volume | Position | CPC | Intent |
|---------|--------|----------|-----|--------|
| boise idaho plumbers | 1,900 | 20 | $35.11 | navigational |
| water softener boise | 140 | 13 | $16.37 | commercial |
| purpose of drainage system | 90 | 12 | N/A | transactional |
| drainage system in plumbing | 90 | 20 | $0.31 | commercial |
| water heater repair boise idaho | 90 | 19 | $40.02 | transactional |
| veterans plumbing near me | 70 | 17 | $14.40 | navigational |
| best plumbers in boise | 40 | 18 | N/A | commercial |
| plumbing company boise idaho | 40 | 20 | $13.77 | navigational |
| proficient plumbing boise | 30 | 18 | $8.88 | transactional |

**"Boise idaho plumbers" at position 20 with 1,900 monthly searches is the single highest-impact opportunity.** Moving this one keyword from position 20 to the top 5 could drive an estimated 100-300+ clicks per month at a CPC value of $35.11 each.

## 7. Quick Wins

These are high-volume keywords where Veterans Plumbing ranks but outside the top 10, and where direct local competitors are demonstrably stronger. These represent the most actionable growth opportunities:

### Tier 1: Striking Distance (currently positions 11-20, highest ROI)

| Keyword | Volume | Current Pos | Action |
|---------|--------|-------------|--------|
| boise idaho plumbers | 1,900 | 20 | Create dedicated "Plumbers in Boise Idaho" service page with testimonials, service areas, and schema markup |
| water softener boise | 140 | 13 | Expand existing water softener page with Boise-specific content, reviews, pricing |
| water heater repair boise idaho | 90 | 19 | Create or expand water heater repair page targeting Boise specifically |
| best plumbers in boise | 40 | 18 | Strengthen social proof on site -- reviews, awards, "Best of" mentions |

### Tier 2: Page 2-3 with High Volume (positions 21-30)

| Keyword | Volume | Current Pos | Action |
|---------|--------|-------------|--------|
| boise plumbers / boise id plumber | 1,900 | 21 | Same as "boise idaho plumbers" -- single strong service page can rank for all variants |
| plumbers in boise | 1,900 | 22 | Same cluster -- optimize for the entire "plumber boise" keyword family |
| veterans plumbing services | 140 | 22 | Strengthen branded service page or homepage title/H1 |
| water softener boise idaho / water softeners boise | 140 | 24-25 | Expand water softener content cluster |
| plumbing companies in boise | 110 | 25 | Local trust signals -- GBP optimization, directory listings |

### Tier 3: Service Area Expansion

| Keyword | Volume | Current Pos | Action |
|---------|--------|-------------|--------|
| plumbing meridian idaho | 1,600 | 46 | Create dedicated Meridian service page |
| plumbers in meridian | 1,600 | 120 | Same -- strong Meridian landing page needed |
| nampa idaho water | 720 | 64 | Expand Nampa-focused content |
| kuna plumber | 140 | 44 | Expand Kuna service page |
| boise heater repair | 170 | 76 | Create dedicated heater repair page |

---

## 8. Content Gap Observations

1. **Missing location pages:** The site ranks for Boise, Meridian, Nampa, Kuna, and Eagle keywords but appears to lack dedicated, optimized pages for each service area. Competitors like cloverdaleplumbing.com and wickstromphc.com rank higher with purpose-built location pages.

2. **Blog content is working:** The "common causes of low water pressure" page ranks for keywords totaling 4,890 monthly searches. This proves informational content can drive visibility. However, it currently ranks at positions 59-77 for those terms, suggesting the content could be improved or better optimized.

3. **Water softener cluster is promising:** Multiple water softener keywords across Boise, Nampa, and Kuna show the domain has topical relevance. A content cluster strategy (pillar page + location-specific subpages) could consolidate authority.

4. **Homepage dependency:** 55 of 101 keyword rankings point to the homepage. This is a structural weakness -- a single page cannot be optimally relevant for 55 different search queries. Distributing these across dedicated service pages would improve rankings across the board.

5. **No paid search presence:** The domain has zero paid keywords, meaning all visibility is organic. While this keeps costs low, it also means competitors running Google Ads are capturing the highest-intent clicks on these terms.

## 9. Recommendations

### Immediate (next 30 days)

1. **Create a "Plumber in Boise" pillar page.** Target the entire "boise plumber(s) / plumbing boise / plumbers in boise" keyword cluster (1,900 searches/mo each variant, 8 variants = massive potential). Include service descriptions, service area map, reviews, FAQ schema, and clear CTAs.

2. **Optimize the water softener pages.** The domain already has pages for Nampa and Kuna water softeners. Create or strengthen a Boise-specific water softener page and interlink the cluster.

3. **Strengthen the water heater repair content.** The "low water pressure hot water heater" blog post shows topical authority. Create a dedicated "Water Heater Repair Boise" service page targeting the transactional keywords (2,400+ volume).

### Short-term (30-90 days)

4. **Build location-specific service pages** for Meridian (1,600 searches/mo), Nampa (720 searches/mo), Kuna (140 searches/mo), and Eagle. Each page should include unique local content, not just city-name swaps.

5. **Google Business Profile optimization.** Many "near me" and "[city] plumber" queries trigger local pack results. Ensure GBP is fully optimized with categories, photos, service areas, posts, and review responses.

6. **Schema markup implementation.** Add LocalBusiness, Service, and FAQ schema to service pages. This improves snippet eligibility and click-through rates.

### Medium-term (90-180 days)

7. **Content marketing expansion.** The water pressure blog post proves informational content works. Develop a content calendar targeting questions homeowners ask: "how much does X cost in Boise," "signs you need a plumber," "water heater vs tankless in Idaho," etc.

8. **Review acquisition strategy.** Reviews influence both local pack rankings and click-through rates. Systematize asking satisfied customers for Google reviews.

9. **Competitor backlink analysis.** cloverdaleplumbing.com achieves an avg position of 13.2 with only 435 keywords -- their link profile and on-page optimization are worth studying in depth.

## 10. Data Files

All raw data is stored in this directory:

- `ranked_keywords.json` -- 101 keywords with volume, CPC, position, intent, and ranking URLs
- `competitors.json` -- 1,000 competitor domains with keyword overlap metrics

---

### Excluded as branded noise

The following keywords contain the brand-adjacent word "veterans" but lack a service identifier (plumbing, heating, water, heater, drain, etc.), making them ambiguous brand queries rather than service-intent signals. They have been excluded from intent clusters, striking distance, and quick wins tables above. The raw data files retain them in full.

| Keyword | Volume | Position | CPC | Reason |
|---------|--------|----------|-----|--------|
| veterans boise | 590 | 29 | $1.27 | Contains "veterans" + location ("boise") but no service word -- could match VA offices, veteran organizations, etc. |

---

### Synthesis Rules Applied

- **A. Keyword Filtering**: No keywords were discarded under this rule (none met both conditions of position >100 AND volume <10 without compensating CPC >= $20).
- **B. Competitor Ranking**: Competitor table limited to top 10 true competitors, ranked by keyword overlap % with veteransplumbingcorp.com (primary), then average position (tiebreaker). Directories and platforms (yelp.com, facebook.com, bbb.org, etc.) excluded. All 999 competitors remain in `competitors.json`.
- **C. Relevance Filter**: 1 keyword ("veterans boise") flagged as branded noise and excluded from synthesis tables. See footnote above.
