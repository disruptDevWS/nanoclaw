## Meta Title

**Plumbers in Boise, ID | Veteran-Owned | Veterans Plumbing**

- Character count: 55
- Primary keyword placement: "Plumbers in Boise" appears first for maximum SERP weight
- Proof signal: "Veteran-Owned" differentiates from every other plumber in the local pack

### Fact-Feel-Proof Breakdown — Title

| Element | Component | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Fact | "Plumbers in Boise, ID" | Core keyword cluster (1,900/mo). Geo-qualified to match commercial search intent. "ID" abbreviation keeps character count under 60 while reinforcing location. |
| Feel | (implicit in structure) | The title reads as a direct answer to the searcher's query — "I need a plumber in Boise" → here they are. Simplicity and directness build confidence. |
| Proof | "Veteran-Owned" | Immediately signals trust, discipline, and accountability. This is the single strongest brand differentiator Veterans Plumbing has vs. local competitors. No other top-10 competitor leads with a veteran identity. |

## Meta Description

**Licensed plumbers in Boise serving the Treasure Valley. Fast repairs, water heaters, and drain cleaning. Veteran-owned with 5-star Google reviews. Call today.**

- Character count: 148
- All three Fact-Feel-Proof elements present
- Ends with CTA ("Call today") to drive click-through from SERP

### Fact-Feel-Proof Breakdown — Description

| Element | Component in Description | Rationale |
|---------|--------------------------|-----------|
| Fact | "Licensed plumbers in Boise serving the Treasure Valley. Fast repairs, water heaters, and drain cleaning." | Names the service (plumbers), location (Boise, Treasure Valley), and specific offerings (repairs, water heaters, drain cleaning). This gives Google three entity signals — service type, geography, and service scope — while telling the searcher exactly what they get. |
| Feel | "Fast repairs" | The word "fast" targets the emotional driver behind most plumbing searches: urgency. Something is broken, leaking, or not working. The searcher needs speed. This is the emotional hook — relief is one call away. |
| Proof | "Veteran-owned with 5-star Google reviews" | Two authority signals in six words. "Veteran-owned" is an E-E-A-T trust signal that AI overviews and LLMs can extract as a named entity attribute. "5-star Google reviews" provides social proof. Together they answer the implicit question: "Can I trust this company?" |

## H1 Tag Recommendation

**Trusted Plumbers in Boise, Idaho — Veteran-Owned & Licensed**

### Rationale

- Includes the primary keyword "Plumbers in Boise" naturally within the heading
- "Trusted" is the Feel element — it answers the searcher's unstated concern (can I trust this plumber?)
- "Idaho" is spelled out (vs. "ID" in the title) to capture the long-tail variant "plumbers in boise idaho"
- "Veteran-Owned & Licensed" serves as dual Proof — ownership identity plus professional credential
- The H1 is intentionally distinct from the meta title to avoid duplication and to capture additional keyword variants

### H1 vs. Homepage H1 Differentiation

| Page | Recommended H1 | Intent |
|------|----------------|--------|
| Homepage `/` | "Boise's Trusted Plumbing Company — Veterans Plumbing Corp" | Navigational (brand hub) |
| This page `/plumber-boise` | "Trusted Plumbers in Boise, Idaho — Veteran-Owned & Licensed" | Commercial (hire a plumber) |

The homepage H1 leads with brand; this page's H1 leads with the service keyword. No cannibalization risk because the intent split is clean: navigational vs. commercial.

## Intent Classification

**Commercial**

The searcher knows they need a plumber and is comparing options. They are not yet at the point of clicking "book now" (that is transactional), but they are past the informational stage. This page must:

1. Rank for the full "boise plumber" keyword cluster (8 variants, 1,900/mo each)
2. Convince the searcher that Veterans Plumbing is the right choice (trust, speed, reviews)
3. Provide a clear path to conversion (phone number, scheduling CTA) without being a pure sales page

| boise id plumber | 1,900 | 21 | Title ("Boise, ID") |
| plumbing boise idaho | 1,900 | 37 | Body content, service section headers |
| best plumbers in boise | 40 | 18 | Body content, FAQ section |
| plumbing company boise idaho | 40 | 20 | Body content, about section |

## Duda Implementation Notes

1. **Meta Title field:** Paste the exact title into Duda's SEO panel > Page Title. Do not append the site name — Duda may auto-append it. If Duda adds " | Veterans Plumbing Corp" automatically, shorten the title to: `Plumbers in Boise, ID | Veteran-Owned` (43 chars) to stay under 60 total.
2. **Meta Description field:** Paste the exact description. Duda does not auto-append to descriptions.
3. **H1 tag:** Set in the page editor's hero section. Ensure it is the only H1 on the page — Duda sometimes creates multiple H1s from section headers.
