## Section 1: H1 + Hero Section
**Word count target:** 100-150 words
**H1:** Trusted Plumbers in Boise, Idaho — Veteran-Owned & Licensed

### Content Direction

Open with the veteran-owned identity in the first sentence. This is the single biggest differentiator in the Boise plumbing market — none of the top competitors (westernhvac.com, rightnowheatcool.com, wickstromphc.com, cloverdaleplumbing.com) lead with a veteran identity. Use it immediately.

**First sentence pattern:** "Veterans Plumbing Corp is a veteran-owned, licensed plumbing company serving Boise, Idaho and the entire Treasure Valley."

Follow with a 2-3 sentence summary of what the company does: residential plumbing repairs, water heater service, water softener installation, drain cleaning, and emergency plumbing. Keep it broad — the detailed service breakdown comes in Section 3.

Mention emergency availability explicitly: "Same-day emergency service available." This captures the urgency-driven searcher who is scanning the page quickly.

**CTA block (visually distinct):**
- Phone number (click-to-call on mobile)
- "Schedule Online" button
- One-line reinforcement: "Licensed. Insured. Veteran-Owned."

### Keywords to use naturally in this section
- "plumbers in Boise" (in or near the H1)
- "Boise, Idaho" (spelled out for long-tail variant capture)
- "veteran-owned" (E-E-A-T and brand differentiation)
- "licensed" (trust signal)

## Section 2: Why Choose Veterans Plumbing
**Word count target:** 200-250 words
**H2:** Why Boise Homeowners Choose Veterans Plumbing Corp

### Content Direction

This section builds the trust case. It answers the commercial-intent question: "Why should I hire this plumber over the others?"

**Subsections (use bold text or icon list, not H3s — keep the H2 authority consolidated):**

1. **Veteran-Owned and Operated** — Explain what this means in practice. Military service instills discipline, punctuality, accountability. These are not just marketing words — they describe how the company operates. This is E-E-A-T proof that AI systems and Google's quality raters can identify as a trust signal. (2-3 sentences)

2. **Licensed and Insured in Idaho** — State the license explicitly. Mention that all work is performed by licensed plumbers, not subcontractors. Insurance protects the homeowner. (2 sentences)

3. **Years Serving Boise** — State how long the company has been in business. If the exact year is not confirmed, use a placeholder: "[X] years serving Boise homeowners." Longevity signals stability. (1-2 sentences)

4. **Fast Response Times** — Same-day service for emergencies. Typical appointment windows for scheduled work. Reinforce that "we show up on time." (2 sentences)

5. **Proven Track Record** — Reference Google review count and rating. If available, mention BBB rating or any "Best of" awards. Pattern: "[X] 5-star Google reviews from Boise homeowners." (1-2 sentences)

### Keywords to use naturally in this section
- "best plumbers in boise" (incorporate naturally, e.g., "Boise homeowners looking for the best plumber...")
- "plumbing company boise idaho"
- "veteran-owned"
- "licensed and insured"

## Section 3: Our Plumbing Services in Boise
**Word count target:** 300-350 words
**H2:** Our Plumbing Services in Boise, Idaho

### Content Direction

This is the service catalog section. Each service gets its own brief paragraph (40-60 words) with a contextual internal link to the dedicated service page where one exists. The goal is to signal breadth of service while pushing the reader deeper into the site.

**Service paragraphs:**

**H3: Residential Plumbing Repairs**
Leak detection, pipe repair, faucet and fixture replacement, toilet repair, garbage disposal installation. Emphasize that no job is too small. Mention that Veterans Plumbing handles both routine maintenance and urgent repairs.

**H3: Emergency Plumbing**
Available for same-day emergency calls. Burst pipes, major leaks, sewer backups, water heater failures. Call the number directly for emergency dispatch. (No internal link — this service is covered on this page itself.)

**H3: New Construction and Remodel Plumbing**
Rough-in plumbing for new builds. Kitchen and bathroom remodel plumbing. Working with general contractors and homeowners in the Boise area. (No dedicated page yet — internal link not needed at this stage.)

### Keywords to use naturally in this section
- "plumbing services in Boise"
- "boise idaho plumbers" (in the H2 or intro sentence)
- "plumbing boise idaho"

### Internal linking note
Every service paragraph must link to the corresponding dedicated page. These contextual internal links are the primary mechanism for distributing authority from this pillar page to the cluster pages. Do not use generic anchor text like "learn more" — use descriptive anchors like "water heater replacement in Boise" or "drain cleaning services."

## Section 4: Service Areas — Treasure Valley
**Word count target:** 200-250 words
**H2:** Serving Boise and the Treasure Valley

### Content Direction

This section signals geographic coverage to search engines and to users. Each city gets its own brief paragraph (30-50 words) with unique local detail — NOT city-name swaps of the same template paragraph.

**City paragraphs:**

**Boise** (primary — 3-4 sentences)
The company's home base. Serve all Boise neighborhoods from the North End to Southeast Boise, the Bench, and the newer subdivisions in West Boise and Harris Ranch. Mention that most Boise calls can be serviced same-day.

**Meridian** (2-3 sentences)
One of Idaho's fastest-growing cities. High demand for plumbing in new construction. Veterans Plumbing serves Meridian homes from subdivisions in South Meridian to established neighborhoods near downtown.
- Internal link: [Plumber in Meridian, Idaho](/plumber-meridian-idaho)

Rapidly expanding bedroom community south of Meridian. Covered by our Treasure Valley service area.

**Eagle** (1-2 sentences)

**Star and Garden City** (1-2 sentences combined)
Both communities are within our standard service radius. Mention proximity to Boise/Meridian for context.

### Keywords to use naturally in this section
- "Treasure Valley" (in H2 and body)
- "plumbers in boise" (reinforcement)
- City names (Meridian, Nampa, Kuna, Eagle — these match long-tail location queries)

## Section 5: What to Expect When You Call
**Word count target:** 150-200 words
**H2:** What to Expect When You Call Veterans Plumbing

### Content Direction

A step-by-step process section that sets expectations and builds trust. This converts the reader who is almost ready to call but wants to know what happens next. Use a numbered list format for scannability.

**Step 1: Call or Schedule Online**
Describe the two options: call the phone number directly, or use the online scheduling form. Mention that someone answers the phone — no phone trees or voicemail during business hours.

**Step 2: We Diagnose the Problem**
A licensed plumber arrives at the scheduled time. They inspect the issue and explain what they find in plain language — no jargon, no upselling.

**Step 3: Upfront Quote**
Before any work begins, you receive a written quote with the full cost. No hidden fees. No surprise charges. You approve the work before we start.

**Step 4: We Fix It Right**
Work is completed to code. The plumber cleans up the work area. You receive a warranty on the labor performed.

**Closing sentence:** "From the first call to the finished job, our goal is to make hiring a plumber in Boise as straightforward and stress-free as possible."

### Keywords to use naturally in this section
- "plumber in Boise" (closing sentence)
- "licensed plumber" (Step 2)

---

## Section 6: Customer Reviews / Testimonials
**Word count target:** 100-150 words
**H2:** What Boise Customers Say About Veterans Plumbing

### Content Direction

This section should display 2-3 real customer reviews pulled from the company's Google Business Profile. The reviews should be formatted in a schema-ready structure so they can be marked up with Review schema in the future.

**Review format (repeat 2-3 times):**

> "[Review text — 1-3 sentences from the actual Google review]"
>
> -- **[Reviewer First Name L.]**, Boise, ID | [Star rating] stars

**Placeholder note for implementation:** Replace these with actual reviews from the Google Business Profile. Select reviews that mention:
1. Speed/response time ("they came out the same day")
2. Quality of work ("fixed the problem right the first time")
3. Professionalism ("on time, clean, explained everything")

**Closing sentence after reviews:** "Read more reviews on our Google Business Profile." (Link to GBP listing.)

### Content note
Do NOT fabricate reviews. Use placeholder brackets if real reviews are not available at content creation time: "[PLACEHOLDER — Insert real Google review here]". It is better to ship with placeholders than with fake testimonials.

## Section 7: FAQ Section
**Word count target:** 250-300 words
**H2:** Frequently Asked Questions About Plumbing in Boise

### Content Direction

Minimum 5 questions targeting the "plumbers in boise" cluster. Each answer should be 2-4 sentences with natural keyword usage. Answers should be commercial in tone — they inform the reader but also guide toward a CTA.

Answer: Yes. Same-day emergency service for burst pipes, major leaks, sewer backups, and water heater failures. Call us directly and we will dispatch a licensed plumber as quickly as possible. Plumbing emergencies do not wait for business hours and neither do we.

**Q4: How do I choose the best plumber in Boise?**

## Content Differentiation Notes

This section clarifies how `/plumber-boise` is distinct from other pages on the site. This is critical to avoid the cannibalization problems identified in Michael's architecture blueprint.

| Page | URL | Intent | How It Differs from /plumber-boise |
|------|-----|--------|------------------------------------|
| Homepage | `/` | Navigational | Brand hub. Routes visitors to the right service page. Does NOT try to rank for "plumbers in boise" — that is this page's job. Distinct H1 ("Boise's Trusted Plumbing Company — Veterans Plumbing Corp"), distinct opening paragraph (brand story, not service pitch). |
| Residential Plumbing Services | `/Residential-Plumbing-Services` | Commercial (cluster) | Deeper service detail. Lists every residential plumbing service with expanded descriptions. This page is the "menu" — /plumber-boise is the "restaurant front door." Different H1, different keyword target ("residential plumbing services boise"). |
| Water Heater Replacement | `/Water-Heater-Replacement` | Transactional | Single-service focus. Only about water heater replacement/installation. /plumber-boise mentions water heaters briefly and links here for detail. No overlap in H1 or meta title. |
| Drain Cleaning Boise | `/drain-cleaning-boise` | Transactional | Single-service focus. Only about drain cleaning. Same relationship as water heater page — brief mention on /plumber-boise with link to the dedicated page. |
| Plumber in Meridian | `/plumber-meridian-idaho` | Commercial | Location variant. Same service breadth as /plumber-boise but targeting Meridian. Distinct H1 with "Meridian" as primary geo. |
| Plumber in Nampa | `/plumber-nampa-idaho` | Commercial | Location variant. Same relationship as Meridian page. Distinct H1 with "Nampa" as primary geo. |

### Key rule for content writers
This page is COMMERCIAL intent — the reader is ready to compare and hire a plumber. Write with conviction and authority. This is not an informational guide about plumbing. Every section should move the reader closer to calling or scheduling. If a sentence does not build trust, demonstrate expertise, or drive action, cut it.

## Duda Implementation Notes

1. **URL slug:** `/plumber-boise` — all lowercase, no trailing slash. Duda creates flat URLs by default.
2. **Page depth:** Must be linked from the homepage and main navigation to achieve depth 1. Verify in Duda's navigation editor.
3. **H1 tag:** Use Duda's heading widget set to H1. Ensure no other element on the page is also set to H1.
4. **Schema injection:** Paste the contents of `schema.json` into Duda's SEO panel > Custom Header Code as a `<script type="application/ld+json">` block. Alternatively, use Duda's built-in schema editor if it supports @graph nesting.
5. **Internal links:** Use Duda's link editor to create relative links (e.g., `/Water-Heater-Replacement`, not full URLs). This preserves links if the domain changes.
6. **Mobile:** Duda is mobile-responsive by default, but verify that the CTA buttons (phone number, schedule online) are prominent and tap-friendly on mobile. The hero CTA should be above the fold on both desktop and mobile.
